# Macdonald's Problem
This repo is my solution for the Maconald's problem that was given as **Design Patterns** Assignment in **2019** at FCIS.

*you will find the code at **src** folder*.

## Problem Statment
### Macdonald's offer three sandwiches:

1. **A cheeseburger** (https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/cheeseburger.html)
Components (In order):
    - LOWER REGULAR BUN (BREAD)
    - BEEF PATTY
    - PASTEURIZED PROCESS AMERICAN CHEESE (CHEESE)
    - KETCHUP (SAUCE)
    - PICKLE SLICES
    - ONIONS
    - UPPER REGULAR BUN (BREAD)

2. **Double Cheeseburger** (https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/double-cheeseburger.html)
Components (In order):

    - LOWER REGULAR BUN (BREAD)
    - BEEF PATTY
    - PASTEURIZED PROCESS AMERICAN CHEESE (CHEESE)
    - BEEF PATTY
    - PASTEURIZED PROCESS AMERICAN CHEESE (CHEESE)
    - KETCHUP (SAUCE)
    - PICKLE SLICES
    - ONIONS
    - UPPER REGULAR BUN (BREAD)

3. **Mushroom & Swiss Burger** (https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/mushroom-and-swiss-burger.html)
Components (In order):
    - LOWER ARTISAN ROLL (BREAD)
    - BEEF PATTY
    - SWISS CHEESE (CHEESE)
    - SEASONED MUSHROOMS
    - FRIED ONION STRINGS
    - BISTRO AIOLI (SAUCE)
    - UPPER ARTISAN ROLL (BREAD)

Also, There are three types of **Meals**:
    1. Sandwich only.
    2. Sandwich + Fries.
    3. Sandwich + Fries + Soda.
## NOTES
- You should implement a meal and sandwich maker where the user only defines the type of sandwich and meal in the main function.
- You should use one (or more) design pattern(s) that you find suitable in your code.
- Your code should thoroughly follow the OOP Design concepts. [For example, notice that different types of cheese should inherit from the same parent]
